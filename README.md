# LUNGE-FOR-THE-WINES
This is a little side project after picking up some fundamental data science topics for Python. 
Marcus found this really interesting dataset about wine reviews on Kaggle:https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews
We decided to each ask a few questions about what we want to know from this dataset and use basic data manipulating methods and plots to answer the questions. 
The project is heavy on manipulating lists and pandas dataframes, basic stats with Numpy and different kinds of plots with matplotlib.

Some interesting findings from the project:
1. Most wines are rated between 87-91. If a wine has a 95+ rating, it's a rare find!
2. A dude named Roger Voss did 25514 wine reviews, the most avid wine reviewer in this dataset, that's 25514 different bottles! And we happen to have his twitter handle in the dataset too... Turns out he is an editor for the Wine Enthusiat Magazine.
3. Switzerland has the most expensive wines (average $85 a bottle!) 
4. Ukraine has the cheapest wines (average $9 a bottle)
5. America has...not the cheapest wines
6. Somehow people really like reviewing Pinot Noir (or they are just the most consumed)
7. The highest rated wine type in this dataset is: Gelber Traminer (What's this??)
8. The most expensive wine type in this dataset is: Ramisco (Again what?)
9. The cheapeast wine tyoe in this dataset is: Trajadura (???)
10. Wine prices and wine ratings have a very confusing but slightly positive relationship
